        <h3 class="abouttitle">About the project</h3>
        <p class="about">Delhi faces a multi-pronged pollution problem. The air is thick with PM2.5 
            and PM10 particles from traffic, factories, and burning crops.  
            The Yamuna River, a vital waterway, suffers from industrial waste and sewage.  
            Landfills overflow, adding to air and soil contamination.  
            Traffic congestion creates constant noise pollution, disrupting daily life. </p>

                <h1 class="poltitle">Land Pollution</h1>
                        <p class="polcont">Delhi's overflowing landfills are a major source of land pollution, contaminating groundwater with harmful leachate.
                            Improper waste management, with only a portion of sewage treated, pollutes the city's soil and water.
                            Industrial activity and agricultural pesticide use can leave toxic residues in Delhi's land.
                            The Yamuna River, vital to Delhi's existence, suffers from heavy pollution due to untreated sewage.
                            Declining groundwater levels due to overuse exacerbate the impact of land contamination.</p>

                <h1 class="poltitle">Air Pollution</h1>
                        <p class="polcont">Delhi's air quality fluctuates wildly, with periods of good air sandwiched between seasons of hazardous pollution.
                            Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), particularly harmful due to its deep lung penetration, is a major culprit.
                            Sources include vehicle emissions, industrial activity, construction dust, and smoke from crop burning in neighboring states.
                            Winter months see a worsening of air quality due to stagnant wind patterns and cold weather trapping pollutants.
                            This toxic cocktail has severe health consequences, causing respiratory problems and even early deaths.</p>

                <h1 class="poltitle">Noise Pollution</h1>
                        <p class="polcont">Honking, construction, and crowded streets make Delhi a cacophony, exceeding safe noise levels in many areas.
                            Traffic congestion, particularly from diesel vehicles, is a key contributor to noise pollution.
                            Residential areas often bear the brunt of noise, despite designated silence zones around hospitals and schools.
                            Constant exposure to noise can lead to hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and increased stress levels.
                            Enforcement of noise regulations and public awareness campaigns are crucial to tackling this issue.</p>

                <h1 class="poltitle">Water Pollution</h1>
                        <p class="polcont">Untreated sewage is the main culprit, discharging massive amounts of harmful waste into the Yamuna River, a vital waterway.
                            Industrial waste, though a smaller contributor, adds toxic chemicals and heavy metals to the water.
                            Low dissolved oxygen levels, caused by organic matter decomposition, threaten aquatic life in the Yamuna.
                            Groundwater sources also face contamination from pollutants leaching through the soil.
                            This polluted water poses health risks and limits its usability for drinking and recreation.</p>
